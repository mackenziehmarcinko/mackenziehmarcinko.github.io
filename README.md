<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>I'm a 5th year graduate student in linguistics at <a href="https://www.lingcogsci.udel.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Delaware.</a> </p> 
  
<p>I'm currently working on my dissertation, which will determine if language attitudes present in a home community are maintained in diaspora, using Quechua as a case study. To this end, I'm conducting a matched guise study of Quechua and Spanish among bilingual participants in the US and in Peru </p>
  
<p> Although my dissertation is a sociolinguistics project, I have previous experience in acoustic analysis and phonetics fieldwork (having travelled to Peru in 2019). I've examined acoustic properties of Quechua ejectives, and I've also contributed to the UD Prosodic Typologies Lab. </p>
  
 <p> Outside of linguistics, I enjoy riding and racing bikes, plus spending time with our kitties (Colby & Jack).</p>
