<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>I'm a 5th year graduate student in linguistics at the University of Delaware.</p>
  
<p>I'm currently working on my dissertation, the goal of which is to determine if language attitudes present in a home community are maintained in diaspora. To this end, I'm conducting a matched guise study of Quechua and Spanish speech in one community in the US and one in Peru (remotely!). </p>
  
<p> Although my dissertation is a sociolinguistics project, I'm also experienced in acoustic analysis. l maintain an interest in descriptive phonetics (having worked on Quechua ejectives and having contributed to the UD Prosody Lab in the past) and typology.</p>
