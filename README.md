<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>I'm a 5th year graduate student in linguistics at <a href="https://www.lingcogsci.udel.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Delaware</a> </p> 
  
<p>I'm currently working on my dissertation, which will determine if language attitudes present in a home community are maintained in diaspora, using Quechua as a case study. To this end, I'm conducting a matched guise study of Quechua and Spanish speech in one community in the US and one in Peru. </p>
  
<p> Although my dissertation is a sociolinguistics project, I'm also experienced in acoustic analysis. I maintain an interest in descriptive phonetics and typology (having worked on Quechua ejectives and having contributed to the UD Prosodic Typologies Lab in the past).</p>
  
 <p> Outside of linguistics, I enjoy riding and racing bikes, plus spending time with our kitties (Colby & Jack).</p>
