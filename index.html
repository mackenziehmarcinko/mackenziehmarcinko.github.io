<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>I'm a 5th year graduate student in linguistics at <a href="https://www.lingcogsci.udel.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Delaware.</a> </p> 
  
<p>I'm currently working on my dissertation, which will examine Quechua language attitudes. To this end, I'm conducting a matched guise study of Quechua and Spanish among bilingual participants in the US & in Peru. Dr. Irene Vogel is my advisor.  </p>
  
<p> My dissertation is a sociolinguistics project, but I also have experience in acoustic analysis and fieldwork (having travelled to Peru in 2019). I've examined acoustic properties of Quechua ejectives in the past, and I've also been involved with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/udstresslab/homeUD" target="_blank">Prosodic Typologies Lab</a> and <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/speech-lab/" target="_blank">the Phon Lab.</a></p>
  
      
<p>My CV is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ju3dER4yjTPGtuG8qUHJucpikXfvUxWv/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

 <p> Outside of linguistics, my main hobby is riding and racing bikes. I also love spending time with our kitties (Colby & Jack).</p>
