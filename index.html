<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>I'm a 5th year graduate student in linguistics at <a href="https://www.lingcogsci.udel.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Delaware.</a> </p> 
  
<p>I'm currently working on my dissertation, which will examine Quechua language attitudes. To this end, I'm conducting a matched guise study of Quechua and Spanish among bilingual participants in the US and in Peru. Dr. Irene Vogel is my advisor.  </p>
  
<p> Although my dissertation is a sociolinguistics project, I have previous experience in acoustic analysis and fieldwork (having travelled to Peru in 2019). I've examined acoustic properties of Quechua ejectives, and I've also made minor contributions to the UD Prosodic Typologies & Phonetics Labs in the past. </p>
  
      
<p>My CV is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ju3dER4yjTPGtuG8qUHJucpikXfvUxWv/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

 <p> Outside of linguistics, my main hobby is riding and racing bikes. I also love spending time with our kitties (Colby & Jack).</p>
